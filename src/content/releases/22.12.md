### v22.12.1
v22.12.1 was released on 29 August, 2023.

[Github link](https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn/releases/tag/v22.12.1)

Release Notes:
```
OVN v22.12.1 - 29 Aug 2023
--------------------------
   - Bug fixes
  - Always allow IPv6 Router Discovery, Neighbor Discovery, and Multicast
    Listener Discovery protocols, regardless of ACLs defined.
  - Send ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets back to offending ports when
    communicating with multichassis ports using frames that don't fit through a
    tunnel. This is done only for logical switches that are attached to a
    physical network via a localnet port, in which case multichassis ports may
    have an effective MTU different from regular ports and hence may need this
    mechanism to maintain connectivity with other peers in the network.
  - Add CoPP for the svc_monitor_mac. This addresses CVE-2023-3153.

    of traffic from a particular client to the same backend for a given
    period of time.
  - ovn-northd: Add configuration knobs to enable drop sampling using OVS's
    per-flow IPFIX sampling.
  - Add support for component templates within logical flows and load
    balancers.
  - Add support for remote port mirroring (Experimental).
  - Add new OVN IC Route table index. This index ensures no duplicate routes
    can be advertized.  When upgrading to this version user must ensure that

    database schema is converted.
